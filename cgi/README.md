## About
Cgi backend which parses my animelist.norg.\
It has to be set up with fcgiwrap or some other cgi wrapper and nginx (or apache if you swing that way).\
It is ran everytime someone loads the page or clicks on an entry in the list to reveal it's review/description.

## Wallpapers
Another cgi backend. This one redirects to a random image from my wallpapers folder (which I use as a background for the main site) or serves all the images in the folder in html.

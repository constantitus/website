            <p style="margin-top: 2px">I want to marry Oyama Mahiro from the Onimai series. Ever since I was a young boy, I've been interested in silver haired girls, but I've been repelled because they are stupid white women who do not know how to think. One day, while I was scrolling through Lowres, I saw an image of a peculiar girl with white hair and a cute ahoge. I immediately fell in love. The long, luscious hair, the girlish and cute attire, the shy, tsundere, yet cute personality all formed into one perfect being by the name of Oyama Mahiro. And so I began my search for Mahiro, I read the entire manga including the extra chapters just so I could the most out of her majesty. I searched all of Danbooru for images of her, just so I could get to see her beautiful tomboyish body. You see, Momiji is not the tomboyish girl in love. Mahiro is. She is in love with me. Yet the reality barrier separates us like Romeo and Juliette. It is the cruel fate that is reality that separates such star-crossed lovers from each other. Only something so powerful as the reality barrier can separate me from my dear Mahiro. For it is my true fate to be married to my lover. On dark days where there is no sun, I shall caress Mahiro and tell her everything is alright. On bright days, where there is nought but bliss, I will stay by her side, to share the bliss infinitefold, like two mirrors in proximity. On the adventurous days, we will steal what we wish. Some days, we will steal diamonds. Some days, we will steal virginities. And always, we will steal our hearts. Each other's hearts. For it is the true love that does not brag, it only contains itself infinitely. Such is the love of me and Mahiro Oyama.
